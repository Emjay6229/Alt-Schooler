    <h4>BIOGRAPHY</h4>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Joshua Onwuemene. I am an AltSchool student currently enrolled in the Cloud Engineering track. 
      I am a graduate of Medical Biochemistry from the prestigious university of Benin, Benin city, 
      but my curiosity for modern technology birthed by my early background tinkering around computers and a strong desire to be an active player in the rapidly evolving technological landscape has led me to explore a career in tech.
      When I am not doing techy stuff, you can find me reading a book, surfing YouTube, listening to music and playing on the keyboard (once in a while though. smiles!).

    <h4>WHY I JOINED ALTSCHOOL</h4>
    <p>
      My rationale for joining AltSchool is to further my understanding of distributed software systems. 
      Precisely, the technical-know-how underlying large scale software system are deployed, maintained and effectively scaled to handle increasing workloads. Hence, my choice of Cloud computing.
      I sought a well-rounded and well-structured programme that provided not only hands-on experience, but mentorship and career support for navigating the tech industry as a budding tech professional.
    </p>
    <h4>MY GOALS</h4>
    <p>
      My goal at AltSchool Africa is quite plain and simple - to graduate with adequate and relevant technical skills needed to excel in Cloud/DevOps engineering. 
      I look forward to starting Cloud Engineering centred projects and exploring all the shiny tools that make applications available to users.
